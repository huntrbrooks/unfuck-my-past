          <h2>Accounts and security</h2>

            You are responsible for your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
          </p>
          <h2>Payments</h2>
          <p>
            Paid features and prices are shown at checkout. To the extent permitted by law, fees are non-refundable once the paid content is delivered, except where Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provides non-excludable rights.
          </p>
          <h2>Australian Consumer Law</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantees, rights or remedies you may have under the ACL. If the Service fails to meet a consumer guarantee, you are entitled to a remedy under the ACL.
          </p>
          <h2>Acceptable use</h2>

          <h2>Content</h2>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of your content. You grant us a limited licence to process your content to provide the Service. You must have the rights to any content you submit.

          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information, including sensitive health information, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
